# Why I Write

Hello.  
This post is an attempt to reflect on the work I've done and to organize how I've been working.

This is not an article that presents a finished definition.  
I am just beginning to put into words the unorganized time and decisions that have passed by.

Individual energy varies even within the same job.  
By organizing the way of thinking and working that was natural to me, I aim to find my own direction moving forward.

# Reflections on Myself

In many organizations, I have been remembered as a fast worker.

Porting new technologies,  
quickly connecting existing systems with external services,  
and solving problems that others could not resolve were roles I took on.

Thus, I was called a "fast developer," a "problem solver."  
Not that these descriptions were wrong, but I almost never worked with speed as the objective.

Being fast was just the result.  
What made that result possible was not 'speed', but an 'obsession with structure'.

# What I Do Well: Structure Created Speed

The reason I could deliver business results quickly was always because I thought of structure first.

- Where did this request originate from?  
- What is essential, and what can be boldly discarded?  
- Which choices can reduce the overall burden on the team?

These were the questions I asked myself first.  
Then I built the minimal necessary structure and piled execution on top of that.

Looking back,  
I found more allure in creating a foundation that could prevent problems from recurring, rather than directly solving problems.

This work kept me focused for long periods, and ultimately enabled fast results.

# The Invisible Structure is Easily Forgotten

Especially in startups, roles are not clearly defined.

Even if there is work on designing structures or reorganizing processes, what is visible from the outside is merely the result: "the problem has been solved."

At best, what remains is the output like frameworks or code structures.

Over time,  
> "It was nothing big after all."  
This became a common summary.

The term 'architect' gradually lost its significance in the changing flow of time.

The process of creating structures and trivializing problems went unrecognized, and its significance easily faded.

In that process, I also failed to develop a language to express myself.

Quietly creating structures in the flow of time, I increasingly lost the means to explain their importance.

# The Dilemma of Being Called an Architect

Reflecting on the work I've done, I sought a language to describe those tasks.

Then I kept coming back to the word 'architect'.

However, I did not want to use it merely as a term for a role.  
The word 'architect' should include the depth of structural thinking and the responsibility of creating a basis for judgments.

I would like to define an architect as **someone who creates a structure that allows for judgment**.

- Not just someone who chooses technologies,  
- But someone who creates conditions that allow for choosing technologies.

Someone who makes it possible for the organization to explain for themselves **why things should be done**.

That is the role of an architect as I see it.

---

# Why Architects are Needed

When an organization is small and immature, solving the immediate problem is the priority.

However, as an organization grows, simply solving each problem individually is no longer sufficient.

Problems recur, and workflows become increasingly complex.

What is needed then is  
- Not more staff,  
- Not more projects,  
but **a structure that prevents problems from recurring**.

I consider an architect to  
> not just be someone who solves problems,  
> but someone who designs structures that prevent problems from recurring.

Creating structures that enable people to make their own judgments and allow the organization to grow on its own.

That is why architects are needed.

# An Engineer's View on SW Architects

From an engineer's perspective, the essence of a software architect is **structural thinking** and **setting reproducible standards**.

SW architects are not merely individuals who handle code or systems.  
Architects are responsible for:

- **Designing structures that can control complexity**  
- **Transforming requirements into structural problems**  
- **Making decisions considering the life cycle of the system**  
- **Explaining the reasons and limitations of technical choices**

From an engineer's standpoint, **structure and standards** must exist before the outcomes.  
These structures and standards make the outcomes **sustainable**.

Therefore, SW architects should be concerned not just with  
> "Can it be built quickly?" but rather  
> "Can a sustainable structure be designed that will not collapse even if built quickly?"

# The Evolution of Architect's Role Over Time

In the past, coding itself took a lot of time.

Compilers and development tools were not as advanced as they are now, and neither were testing environments and deployment automations well-established.

As a result, architects had to focus on:
- System modeling using UML,  
- Algorithm design using Pseudocode,  
- Detailed and sophisticated documentation.

Code production was high-cost and high-risk, so meticulously designing the structure in advance was the core task.

However, the situation has changed significantly now.

- The sophistication of development tools and frameworks,  
- The expansion of the open-source ecosystem,  
- DevOps-based automated deployment environments,  
all of these have dramatically increased the speed of code writing and verification.

Now, architects must focus more on  
- Designing flexible structures that can withstand changes and expansions,  
rather than perfect pre-planning.

In a rapidly changing technical environment,  
the modern architect's task is not to create a **finished design**, but to build a **structure strong against changes**.

# The Shortage of Design Supply and the Emergence of Automation

In the rapidly changing development environment, it has been difficult to allocate sufficient structural design and architects to every project.

The supply of design has not kept up with the increase in development speed and requirements.

As a result,  
- Instead of manually controlling complexity, **operations and deployment were automated (DevOps)**,  
- Instead of developing features directly, **consuming them in the form of services (SaaS)** became a stronger trend.

DevOps was an attempt to  
> automate the complexity of infrastructure and deployment,  
> compensating for the lack of design with operational automation.

SaaS was a result of  
> abstracting individual features and  
> facilitating rapid integration.

These changes have created a development environment that produces outcomes quickly through fast combinations and integrations, rather than meticulously designing structures.

Today's development culture demands **the ability to adapt to changes** rather than **sophisticated structural design**.

---

# The New Role Required of Architects

Architects should not merely follow the old methods.

In today's environment,  
- Automation through DevOps,  
- Functional abstraction through SaaS,  
Architects need to not just follow these trends but **understand them structurally and combine them effectively**.

That is, **how to use automation and SaaS to design and propose an efficient and maintainable development structure suitable for the organization**.

Architects must  
- Not be swept away by the flow,  
- Interpret the flow structurally, and  
- Create practical alternatives that fit the organization's rhythm.

I believe that **designing a foundation that allows the organization to grow stably amidst changes** is the new role given to architects today.

And I am committed to striving and implementing to achieve this goal.

# The Structure I Want to Create

I want to create a structure that connects scattered executions with direction and context.

So that the organization does not remain with one-time results, but
- Execution creates flow,  
- Flow creates structure,  
- Structure supports the entire organization's judgment and execution.

Specifically,

- Resistant to change,  
- Capable of expansion,  
- Understandable and maintainable by people on their own,  
**a living structure** is what I aim to create.

Not just a structure for technology, but a structure that connects people and execution.

That is the direction I want to take moving forward.

# In Closing — The Process of Creating a Definition

I do not yet have a finished definition.

The word 'architect' cannot be described in a form that everyone can relate to.

But what is clear is that **I am in the process of creating the meaning of an architect for myself**.

- Repeating structural thinking,  
- Interpreting structures in the changing flow,  
- Finding practical alternatives suitable for the organization.

This post is the first attempt to record that process.

I will continue to ponder, confront, and revise, aiming to **complete my own definition of an architect**.
