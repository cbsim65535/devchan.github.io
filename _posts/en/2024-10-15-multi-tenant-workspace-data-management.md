## **Service Overview**

Our **Multi-Tenant Architecture-Based Data Management Service** is a platform designed to securely manage and support multiple workspaces (tenants). The data for each tenant is managed according to strict **data isolation** principles, providing a customized environment for each workspace that enables efficient and stable operations.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Workspace Service Provision Through Data Isolation**

The data of each workspace (tenant) is completely separated and managed. We provide either **logical isolation** or **physical isolation** designed to prevent data access between tenants, ensuring **enhanced security** and **data integrity**.

### 2. **Logical and Physical Isolation**

- **Logical isolation**: Shares one database but stores data segregated based on tenant ID.
    - **Advantages**: Cost-effective, provides rapid scalability
- **Physical isolation**: Provides each tenant with a separate database or infrastructure.
    - **Advantages**: Ensures the highest level of security and isolation

### 3. **Flexible Pricing Structure**

- **Logical Isolation**: Offers a billing model that considers cost-efficiency and scalability
- **Physical Isolation**: Customized billing models suited for workspaces requiring advanced security with dedicated infrastructure
- **Resource Usage-Based Billing**: Quantifies the resources (storage, computing) used by each tenant to transparently manage costs.

## **Expected Benefits**

1. **Customized Services for Each Workspace**
Allows the selection between logical or physical isolation depending on the requirements of each workspace, enabling customized services.
2. **Guaranteed Data Security and Integrity**
Maximizes data security for each workspace through a strict isolation policy.
3. **Cost Optimization**
Provides optimized billing models based on the size and security level of the workspace, enabling efficient cost management.
4. **Scalability and Stability**
The multi-tenant structure facilitates quick onboarding of new workspaces (tenants) while maintaining system performance.
