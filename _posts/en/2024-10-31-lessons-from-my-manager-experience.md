# 1. **The Importance of Listening**
Above all, it was "listening" that mattered.  
As a manager, the first lesson I learned was that **the surest way to make team members feel respected is by listening**.

- The act of listening itself creates trust.
- Rather than giving feedback quickly, it's better to listen sufficiently first to create a better direction.
- When team members feel that their opinions are taken seriously, they engage more proactively in their work.

# 2. **Sometimes Ignorance is a Strength**
A manager who pretends to know everything ruins the conversation.  
A frequent mistake I made while leading the team was **offering answers too quickly** or judging the present by past experiences.

- Saying "back in my day" is essentially **showing off experience**.
- A manager should be a **catalyst that facilitates the flow of conversation**, not a **stage for displaying knowledge**.
- When you ask questions, observe, and wait, more voices emerge.

# 3. **Questions are More Important Than Decisions**
Initially, I thought that being a leader naturally meant I had to make decisions.  
However, I realized that real leadership is **enabling the team to make decisions themselves through questioning**.

- "How can we solve this?" is much more powerful than "Let's do it this way."
- Questions lead to thinking, and through that process, **decision-making skills** develop.
- With practice, the team increasingly makes faster and better decisions.

# 4. **Transparent Sharing of the Decision-Making Process**

The most challenging thing for me was **sharing my intuition**.  
Managers often make quick decisions based on experience-driven intuition. However, if the reasons are not shared with the team, it appears as an **"opaque decision"**.

- Intuition, if not explained, can be mistaken for **authority**.
- What I did: **I wrote down the basis of my intuition and shared it as a document after meetings**.
- Although it took time and there were many trials and errors, ultimately, this habit greatly helped in enhancing the judgment of the entire team.
