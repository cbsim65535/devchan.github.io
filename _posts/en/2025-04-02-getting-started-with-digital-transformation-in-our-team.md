# Introduction

We have repeatedly made big and small mistakes in our work.

Some knew about these mistakes, while others did not.

Those trying something for the first time always started from scratch,

and the lessons and experiences accumulated in the process often faded away.

Now, to reduce such repetitions,

we aim to organize and share ‘how we should work’ together.
This starting point is precisely DX, **Digital Transformation**.

This document introduces the direction and philosophy of DX at our company.

For new members joining us, through this document
**why we consider DX important**,
**how we would like to work together** can be understood.

And this document is not just to be read and forgotten.

It is to serve as our team’s **cultural guide to working**, to be referred back to whenever needed.

# I. Understanding DX

## 1. What is DX?

DX originally stands for Digital Transformation,
where ‘X’ symbolizes Transformation or Cross-over.

However, rather than a technical interpretation, it’s more fitting for us to understand it as **‘changing the way we work’**.

We constantly write, transmit, and search for information in our work.
In this process, mistakes occur, omissions happen, and repetitive tasks arise.
DX is the activity of **making these processes clearer, more structured, and easier for everyone to use**.

Thus, DX is not about implementing systems but about **improving the culture of work**.

For instance,
- `Changing approval documents to online formats so they don’t get lost`,
- `Organizing meeting contents into templates`,
- `Keeping records of frequently asked questions`

All these activities are part of DX.

The reason we pursue DX is simple.
**To create a team that works more efficiently and collaborates better.**

And that starts with reflecting on ‘how we work’ and collectively creating better workflows.

---

## 2. The Direction of DX We Aspire To

Our envisioned DX is not just about implementing systems or changing tools.
**The core lies in enhancing work efficiency**.

- Reducing unnecessary repetitions,
- Avoiding repeating the same mistakes,
- Ensuring important information is not forgotten

Improving these everyday aspects defines the DX we aim for.

Many of the issues in work can actually be prevented by just organizing the flow of tasks a bit.
If such awareness spreads throughout the organization, issues will not be seen merely as individual mistakes, but as opportunities to create better workflows.
**We aim to create a culture that learns from mistakes rather than blaming them.**

We have faced various trials and errors in the past.
There have been instances of missing approvals and many instances of information discontinuity.
However, those experiences were not in vain.

Every time, we asked ourselves, ‘How can we reduce these mistakes?’,
and that question became the starting point for creating new flows and methods.

**Automation is just a tool.**
What’s important is that we recognize repetitive mistakes and
**actively participate in improving the workflow to reduce these mistakes.**

This attitude and approach are the essence of the DX we talk about,
and this document is created to share that direction together.

---

## 3. Misunderstandings and Truths About DX

To many, the phrase 'Digital Transformation (DX)' sounds complicated and daunting.
Questions like ‘Do we need to implement new systems?’, ‘Do we have to learn technology?’, ‘Will work become more complicated?’ often precede.
However, **our DX is about simplifying the workflow, not complicating it with systems**.

DX is never a technology-centric project.

Our DX is ‘people-centric’.
To work better, to collaborate better, to minimize mistakes,
**it’s about minimally adjusting tools and procedures**.

Sometimes, creating procedures is misunderstood as trying to control.
However, in reality, it is about **creating the minimal structure to make work freer and clearer**.
If it's predetermined what information needs to be included in a document, it can actually reduce the thinking time.
If the approval flow is organized, there’s no need to wonder ‘who’s next?’.

DX does not make work uncomfortable but rather,
**creates a framework that helps work go better**.
The core is always about **‘people’ and ‘collaboration’**.

---

## 4. Conditions for DX Suitable for Startups

When attempting DX in a startup, the most common concern is “Doesn’t this slow us down?”.
This is true. **Procedures that are merely formalistic or unnecessary rules are toxic to startups.**
Therefore, the DX we talk about is different from the digital transformation of typical corporations.

Finding ways to ‘reduce mistakes’ and ‘improve work efficiency’ without losing 'speed' is crucial.
Here, the important thing is not to organize everything, but **to organize only what is necessary**.
The minimal flow to reduce mistakes, simple records to prevent duplication, standards that everyone can follow.
This should be sufficient.

From experience, just having these small but important standards has significantly changed the entire team's productivity.
A single document, a single procedure can set the direction for the entire team.
**This small organization enables faster execution**.

Therefore, DX is not about slowing us down, but rather,
**like a seatbelt that turns dangerous speed into ‘sustainable speed’**.
Finding how to run safely but quickly, that is the DX suitable for startups.

# II. The Core Philosophy of DX

## 5. Transitioning the Way We Work

DX is, before technology, about **changing how we think about the way we work**.
To reduce the repeated mistakes, omissions, and confusion we face while working,
**how we write information, how we share it, and how we find it again** are the starting points.

Previously, a lot of work was conveyed through speech or depended on memory.
However, as people change and time passes, memories fade, and information is forgotten.
Most of our work is actually about the ‘flow of information’, and the blurrier this flow, the more mistakes occur.

Therefore, we aim to transition not just to ‘getting the job done’,
but to a method where **how work was done is recorded and organized so it can be checked again**.
This transition is not grandiose but starts from simple practices like briefly recording meeting contents, organizing them in a certain way,
and making them easily accessible to the necessary people.

We aim to standardize this flow.
Having a simple flow of **‘Write → Share → Look up’** in a common manner across the team,

That is the core of DX and the transition in our way of working.

## 6. The Role and Principles of Processes

Many people think of processes as rigid and complex procedures when they hear the word.
However, the processes we talk about are not such.
**We just aim to create flows that reduce mistakes and help us work better together**.

In actual work, unexpected mistakes often occur.
For instance, important approvals might be missed, transferred information might be incorrect, or nobody knows who made certain decisions.
These mistakes are not due to people but occur because the flow of work is not organized.

Therefore, we document ‘approval flows’ or ‘work standards’.
**To ensure that new people do not repeat the same mistakes,**
**so that everyone can move based on the same standards,**
we keep our own work flows organized.

These flows are never fixed.
They should be updated based on practical experience,
**repeatedly becoming more stable and robust methods,**
that is the role of processes we envision.

Processes are not for control,
**but for better collaboration and efficient execution**.

## 7. Focus and Selection: Design Criteria for Work Flow

Organizing everything into rules can actually complicate work.
In DX, although we organize the workflow, **this flow must focus only on ‘what is necessary’**.

If there is an effective flow to prevent mistakes, it should be used as a standard,
and other flows should **allow flexibility and judgment**.
 
When we design our work flow, the criteria are simple.

> “Does this help reduce mistakes?”
> “Does keeping this flow make it easier for the next person to work?”

If the answer to these questions is ‘yes’,
then that flow is **worth documenting as a process and worth keeping as a record**.

From our past work experience,
a few important flows have prevented repetitive mistakes,
and these flows have been documented to become assets for the team.

Even if not everything is organized into a workflow,
**clearly defining the important flows and keeping reasons and outcomes together.**
That is our way of focusing and selecting our workflows.

## 8. Records Are Assets of the Company

Every day we make big and small decisions, solve problems, correct mistakes, and collaborate.
However, if all these processes are not properly recorded, it’s like starting over from scratch every time.
Therefore, we consider ‘recording’ not just as simple note-taking, but as **an asset of the company**.

Records help us trace back **accurate information when needed later**.
For instance, why certain decisions were made, what criteria were used, who played what role—
if all this information is well organized, new members can quickly understand and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Records are the memory of the team and a device that maintains the continuity of work.
Moreover, as the organization grows, **more and more records are needed**.

However, simply writing a lot is not enough.
**Records must be easy to find and must be organized in a structured manner** to be meaningful.
Therefore, we use platforms that are good at searching,
record content through consistent templates,
and store them in forms that are easily accessible to anyone.

Records are experiences,
and experience accumulated in records becomes an asset that strengthens the company.

# III. Implementing DX

## 9. Practical Application Examples

We did not start DX in a grand manner.
The first thing we tackled was the **paper-based approval process**.

Previously, for approvals, documents were printed, signed, and physically transferred.

If the approver was absent, work could be delayed for days, and sometimes documents were lost and had to be rewritten.

Although it seemed minor, it slowed down the entire team and often caused mistakes like omissions and duplications.

So, we decided to switch the approval flow online.
First, we created **templates that were easy for everyone to fill out**.

When it was predetermined what items must be included, the document creators could write more effortlessly,

and approvers could check all the necessary information without missing anything.

Next, **we visually structured the approval process**.
This allowed everyone to see at a glance who the next approver was and how far the review had progressed.

Also, all records were automatically saved so that they could be searched and referred back to later.

Sometimes, templates are misunderstood as a format where "all items must be filled out."

So, we need to clearly explain.
**Templates are just tools, and they serve as a reference structure to aid better decision-making**.

There’s no need to fill out every item, but if records are kept,
better judgments and collaborations are possible, which team members should understand through **the onboarding process**.

Although these were small changes, the effects were clear.

Mistakes decreased, approval speed increased, and work flows became much clearer.
**DX starts with changing even a small flow, not with grand projects**.

## 10. Conditions for Change Management

DX doesn’t complete by just changing tools or systems.
**The core of change is people, and it’s crucial to create a culture where people naturally use new workflows**.

Whenever we attempt any change, there are conditions we must consider.
First is **the choice of appropriate tools**. Tools should be familiar to us and should not complicate our work.
Instead of having many features, **simple and intuitive tools that fit our work flow are more effective**.

Second is **clarifying roles and responsibilities**. If it’s not clear who does what when change begins, confusion arises.
When designing the flow of change, we try to define **who decides, who checks, and who concludes each step**.

Third is **onboarding**. New people start without knowing the existing culture.
No matter how good a flow we have created, if they don’t understand it, mistakes will repeat.
Thus, we prepare materials that help **new members quickly adapt and learn**.

Lastly, **repetition and feedback** are important.

We do not consider any flow perfect from the start.
**Starting small, getting feedback while applying, and gradually improving to a better flow** is how we view change management.

# IV. DX as Culture

## 11. DX and Organizational Culture

DX may seem like changing tools or procedures,
but its essence is about organizing the organization's attitude towards **‘how we work together’**.

We do not see DX as merely introducing systems.
Rather, it’s the first thing a new team member should understand — **our way of working, i.e., DX**.
**How we record work, how we share it, and how we minimize mistakes, this agreed-upon culture** is what DX is.

Collaboration starts with trust.
Trust arises from transparent information sharing and consistent execution.
We aim to nurture such a trust-building culture through DX.

Moreover, DX should be a culture based on **autonomy and participation**,
where the people working together choose and improve their tools and flows.
When DX becomes a flow that everyone creates together,
it settles not just as a mere system but as a **living culture**.

Leaders should demonstrate this culture, encourage it, and practice it.
Sharing well-organized documents, explaining standards transparently,
and kindly guiding the flow of work when someone new joins are actions that embed DX as a culture.

## 12. Conclusion

DX is about changing the way we work and ultimately creating a culture.

We are not just introducing tools or organizing procedures,
**but together creating an environment where all members can collaborate without mistakes**.

This document is the standard and starting point for that journey.

Everyone can make mistakes, but creating workflows that prevent them from repeating,

sharing and advancing those workflows is the direction we pursue.

The crucial thing is not to have a perfect system,
**but to continuously check and improve** and **create a culture of growth together**.

DX should not be a static document,

but a living standard that changes and evolves with our work.

In the future, this document will continue to evolve, reflecting our experiences, changed flows, and new lessons.
And at the center of that change will be **your experiences and participation**.

## Appendix: Case Study on Using the CS → Development Team Issue Transfer Template

### Background

The Customer Support (CS) team is a critical link in conveying issues that arise on the ground to the development team. However, mere communication such as "there was a problem, and here is what it is," is insufficient for accurate cause analysis.

The development team needs the following information to understand the problem accurately and trace its cause:

- Were there any changes?
- Who made what modifications?
- Why and in what context were those decisions made?

People forget. Therefore, we need to **structure and record information so it can be searched later**.
To this end, the CS team began using a template when transferring issues, contributing to reducing repetitive feedback and enhancing communication accuracy.

---

### Issue Transfer Template Item Configuration

| --- | --- |
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Location | Installation site of the device, address, etc. |
| Contract number | Unique ID to identify the customer contract |
| Customer contact | Phone number and other real-time contact means |
| Customer response availability | Time slots when the customer can respond |
| Contact availability | Current state of contact availability (Y/N) |
| Customer registration information | Customer name, registering organization, date of registration, etc. |
| Customer contract requirements | SLA, special conditions, etc. (linked with contract number) |
| Product number | Model name or code of the equipment where the issue occurred |
| Product registration number | Unique identification number of the equipment |
| Receipt time | When the CS team received the issue |
| Time customer noticed the problem | When the customer noticed the symptoms |
| Symptom reproduction frequency | Always/intermittent/under specific conditions, etc. |
| Customer desired response | Replacement/visit/phone/remote support, etc. |
| --- | --- |

---

### Utilization Method

- Online tools help with quickly entering necessary information through search-based auto-completion.
- The CS team organizes customer issues based on this template and transfers them to the development team.
- Rather than enforcing mandatory items, it’s designed with a searchable keyword structure to help quickly find necessary information.
- The development team uses the transferred content to trace related changes, logs, past cases, and respond swiftly.

---

### Effects and Lessons

- Sometimes, just the process of checking based on the template, even if no conclusion is reached, becomes meaningful decision-making information.
- The fact that there are no answers for certain items is also part of the record and serves as important evidence for subsequent judgments.
- Repeated inquiries decrease, and the speed of problem identification improves.
- The template is not just a simple form but acts as a structure for defining problems and a connection point for collaboration.
- This showcases that DX is not just about procedures but about creating better workflows through recording and sharing.

## Supplementary Material: Why 'Writing Well and Searching Well' is Important in DX

The essence of Digital Transformation (DX) is not just about adopting technology but about changing the flow of information and transforming collaboration methods. The core of this flow is precisely **writing "well" and "searching well"**. Below are the main reasons explaining its importance.

---

### 1. DX is about changing information flows

- McKinsey defines digital transformation as "a fundamental reorganization of an organization, continuously deploying technology on a large scale to create value." This clearly indicates that it's not simply about adopting systems but about transforming the flow of information and operational methods within an organization.
- Additionally, the TDWI report describes DX as "using electronic devices to transition an organization from one state to another," emphasizing it as an information flow-centered transition that changes business interactions into a human-computer-human structure.

- The way of writing (templates, standards) and the way of searching (search, metadata) govern this flow.

Information Work for You
>
> "Are we writing well for ourselves?" "Can we easily find it later?"

---

### 2. Assetization of knowledge

- In the digital age, it's more important who can find and share information quickly rather than who knows more.
- If it's not recorded, it disappears; if it's not searchable, it's as if it doesn't exist.
- A culture of writing well and searching well turns knowledge into an organizational asset, not just an individual's.

> Harvard Business Review: Why Organizations Don’t Learn (2016) “An organization that isn't remembered doesn't learn repetitively.”

---

### 3. Search efficiency and work efficiency

- According to a McKinsey report, knowledge workers spend more than 20% of their daily work time searching for information.
- This amounts to about 9 hours weekly and 400 hours annually.
- Just having a searchable document structure and recording habits can significantly reduce this time waste.

---

### 4. Improved onboarding and problem-solving speed

- According to Deloitte research, an effective knowledge management system can shorten the onboarding speed by up to 30%.
- Well-written records and searchable platforms are the starting points for sustainable collaboration.
