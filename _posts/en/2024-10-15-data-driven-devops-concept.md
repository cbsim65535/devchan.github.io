## 1. **Team Strategy**

- **Knowledge Management and Collaboration Culture:** Utilize centralized knowledge management tools and real-time collaboration tools to manage the team's knowledge and problem-solving methods, and facilitate rapid collaboration.
- **Real-time Collaboration and Notification System:** Enhance real-time communication and feedback, and establish a system that can share critical notifications immediately.
- **Phased Introduction of Automation Tools:** Gradually introduce serverless container management tools and IoT device management tools to reduce initial complexity.
- **Preparation for Transition to Microservices Architecture:** Transition from monolith to microservices to ensure system flexibility and scalability.
- **Data-driven Decision Making Automation:** Make quick decisions and optimize operations using real-time data analysis tools.
- **Lightweight Strategy:** Use lightweight procedures and essential tools suitable for small teams to optimize resources and increase efficiency.

## 2. **Development Process Management**

Key points:

- **Source Code Management:** Enhance rapid code merging and work speed through a PR minimization strategy, and realize efficient branch management through a lightweight branch management strategy.
- **Monorepo Management:** Use dependency management tools and package management tools to eliminate duplicate packages and achieve consistent dependency management.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the build, test, and deployment processes using CI/CD pipeline automation tools, and deploy each microservice independently.
- **Deployment Failure Handling Strategy:** Quickly address issues during deployment using automatic and manual rollback procedures, and recover quickly when problems occur.

## 3. **AWS-based API Authentication and IoT Management**

- **API Management:** Maintain API documentation using API specification automation tools, and enhance service reliability through API request limitations and security enhancements.
- **Authentication and User Management:** Automate user management processes and enhance security using user authentication and permission management tools.
- **IoT Management and Operations:** Manage various IoT devices in real-time using IoT device management tools, and monitor device status using a digital twin strategy.

## 4. **Knowledge Management, Collaboration Culture, Alarm Service**

- **Knowledge Management:** Use centralized knowledge management tools to record key information of the team and centrally manage frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- **Enhancing Collaboration Culture:** Link real-time collaboration tools with knowledge management tools to support real-time communication and problem-solving, and strengthen the collaboration culture.
- **Alarm Service:** Use system monitoring and alarm tools to detect performance issues in real-time and respond quickly through real-time notifications.

## 5. **Data Strategy**

- **Data Collection and Storage:** Use serverless computing tools and streaming data processing tools to collect real-time data, and utilize object storage services for long-term data storage.
- **Data Processing and Flow Management:** Build data pipelines using data processing automation tools and maintain consistent data flow.
- **Data Analysis and Insight Extraction:** Analyze stored data and provide immediate insights through real-time analysis using SQL-based data analysis tools.
- **Visualization and Monitoring:** Visualize data and monitor performance issues in real-time using system monitoring tools to detect and resolve issues early.
