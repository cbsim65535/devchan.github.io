title: Is Our Agile Really 'Agile'?

Sprints rotate, and meetings are held regularly.

The backlog is also neatly organized.

However, we often struggle to set goals for each sprint.

We have a product we want to make, but **we don't know where to start**  
and more fundamentally, we didn't even know **why we should make it**.

**Why make it**—where are the customers?

There were no **‘customers’** in the meetings, in the backlog, or in the PM's explanations.

At that moment, I asked myself.

> “Is our Agile really ‘Agile’?”

## Agile is not about splitting schedules

Many teams focus on adopting the form of Agile as they introduce it.  
Daily scrum, sprint retrospectives, Kanban boards, backlog management…

However, if **“being able to stick to the schedule”** becomes more important than **“what to make,”**  
Agile just becomes a **tool for job control**.

> “Who is the customer of this product, and  
> what problem are they experiencing?”

## Defining the customer is the leader's responsibility

So, as a leader, I decided to start again with the **simplest question**.

> “If I, a developer, were using it, what functionality would I need?”

Using this question as a starting point, we began to approach from the perspective of **internal users**.  
Imagining the **context and situation** in which the actual product would be used,  
we defined personas based on **real-life users** like elderly parents or franchise owners.

Then, based on these personas, we created **scenarios** and  
developed **working prototypes** to **share with internal users**.

> “My mom can't use this.”  
> “It seems hard for a store owner to switch screens.”

This wasn't just simple UI feedback.  
It was the moment when **the context of the customers first entered our team**.

From then on, we became a team that asks **‘who is it for?’ before ‘what features should we make?’**.

## Instead of 2-week sprints, 2-day experiments

For faster validation, I suggested a structure where  
**we share working prototypes every two days instead of every two weeks**.

The goal was not to ‘complete,’ but to  
> “Are we moving in a meaningful direction for our customers?”  
to create **small, runnable pieces of code** that could verify this.

The team's responses varied.  
Some shared their outcomes every two days,  
while others said, “I'll share it in the next cycle.”

I didn't see this difference as a problem.  
**Adapting to an unfamiliar method takes time, and that process is also part of Agile**.

As we repeated these experiments,  
**those with high execution power became the core of the flow**,  
and all members began to view functions from the customer's perspective.

## Agile is ultimately a philosophy of leadership

I still think Agile is a good methodology.  
However, I believe that for Agile to really work,  
**culture and philosophy must follow**.

Especially in **Korean organizational culture**,  
Agile is often used only as a ‘system to control schedules,’ and  
customers are erased from meetings, feature definitions, and feedback loops.

Agile should  
**help organizations learn, validate, and adjust directions**.

And that structure starts with **the leader's question**.

> “This feature we are creating,  
> **does it really mean something to someone?”**

As long as we don't give up on this question,  
I believe Agile can always come back to life.
