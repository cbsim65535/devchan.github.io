### **Technology Should Be Judged Product-Centric**

I always design technology architectures based on the product lifecycle.

**Predicting the likelihood of product issues and the burden of maintenance**,

**Prioritizing structures that consider delivery efficiency and scalability**.

### **Technology Selection is Judged from an Execution Perspective**

I derive the most efficient framework and decide on the technology stack considering the team's situation and resources.

Considering both feasibility and sustainability,

**I have designed strategies that include structures for expansion and organizational setup**.

### **Communication with Business is the Starting Point of Technology Strategy**

I believe that the first step in problem-solving is **communication with the business domain**.

My approach is to launch products quickly through focus and selection, keeping scalability in mind.
