> `gpt-4-turbo` has translated this article into English.

### **Technology Should Be Judged Product-Centric**

I always design the technological architecture based on the product lifecycle.

**Predicting the likelihood of product issues and the burden of maintenance**,

**Prioritizing structures that consider delivery efficiency and scalability**.

---

### **Technology Choices Are Judged from an Execution Perspective**

I derive the most efficient framework and decide on the technology stack considering team conditions and resources.

Taking into account both feasibility and sustainability,

**Designing strategies that include hiring structures and organizational setups for expansion**.

---

### **Communication with Business is the Starting Point of Technology Strategy**

I believe that the first step in problem-solving is **communication with the business domain**.

Determining what the priorities are, and which choices are 'the necessary actions needed now',

My approach is to quickly launch products through focus and choice, while leaving room for scalability.
