### The Start of a Development Culture: ‘Transparent Information Sharing’ and ‘Building a Knowledge Base’

I believe that the most crucial elements for creating a healthy development culture are **transparent information sharing** and **systematic knowledge base construction**.

In the past, a developer's personal know-how and technical knowledge were considered their competitive edge and uniqueness. Due to this, there wasn't much of an atmosphere that encouraged easy teaching or sharing. I have also worked in such an environment.

However, today, the pace of technological change has accelerated significantly. Information that was useful a few years ago can quickly become outdated within a year or two. In such an environment, it holds much more value to **share, organize, and accumulate** information rather than just protecting it.

Documenting what you know and organizing it into an easily accessible **knowledge base to share with team members**.

Through this process, knowledge no longer remains an individual's possession but becomes **an asset of the team**. As this asset continues to accumulate, it naturally enhances the team’s competitiveness and establishes itself as a culture.

I always place great importance on **documenting and systematizing** information, making it easy for anyone to find and utilize.

When these habits accumulate, **the entire team's learning speed** increases, onboarding of new members becomes smoother, and the speed of problem-solving also improves.

Therefore, I believe that the core and beginning of a development culture is

**transparently sharing information and organizing it into a knowledge base to create a foundation for everyone’s growth**.
