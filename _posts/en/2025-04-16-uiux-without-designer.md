# **Structural Design Case Study for Delivering an App on Schedule While Maintaining Design Quality Without a UI/UX Designer**
We approached the situation with the philosophy that **when lacking personnel, one should design processes, not tools**.

---

## Problem Recognition

We were in a situation where we needed to develop an app  
but no UI/UX designer was assigned.  
We had to proceed without a planner, and  
**all design decisions fell to the developers,  
risking design quality, collaboration efficiency, and adherence to schedules.**

## My Design Philosophy

**In situations with a lack of personnel, 'flow' rather than 'function' should be designed first.**  
I believe that in such times, the role of a structural designer is  
**to create a system that does not require communication.**  
Alignment rather than communication, interfaces rather than agreements are key.

## Design Direction

- **Adoption of Ant Design-based front-end framework**  
  → Even without UI design, structurally stable component-based screen configuration is possible.

- **Collaboration with a publishing designer to introduce a theme parameter system**  
  → Visual elements such as color, typography, and spacing are variable through code.

- **Design of a theme editor capable of real-time deployment**  
  → Designers can adjust styles directly and see results immediately.

- **Viewer page-based communication system**  
  → Designing a feedback loop focused on results, not explanations.

## Results

- Maintained UI quality without a designer  
- Developers focused on components, designers on themes  
- Completed app delivery without schedule delays  
- Structured the same architecture for reusable form → **Applicable repeatedly in Lean organizations**

## In Conclusion

A structure that collapses without people is an un-designed structure.  
Through this case study, I reconfirmed that **the role of a structural designer is not to compensate for a team's deficiency  
but to create a structure that can manage that deficiency.**

In organizations that operate Lean,  
it is crucial to have structural designs that can "function without a designer."
