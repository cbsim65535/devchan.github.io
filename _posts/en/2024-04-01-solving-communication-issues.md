## "Why Does This Issue Keep Repeating?"

The operations team was concerned about customer service, the development team was pondering exception handling in features, and the planning team explained that the original intent had not been properly conveyed.

Everyone was making valid points, but the conversation was somehow misaligned.

We were too focused on solving the problem quickly, and in the process, **we were losing sight of the core value that should be delivered to the customer.**

As the service rapidly expanded, we failed to properly manage its essence, and even the language and standards of communication varied from team to team.

In such situations, what is most needed is to provide an **integrated design architecture** that includes language, systems, and domains, and through this, create an **effective communication system** among teams. Additionally, we must design **common standards and consistent collaboration methods** based on customer-centric thinking.

## Connecting Technology and Collaboration to Solve Problems

I have frequently encountered communication breakdowns and recurring technical issues between planning, development, and operations in various organizations.

Through these experiences, I found that the problems were not merely technical. **As teams interpreted and responded to issues differently in a state where communication and systems were separated**, greater confusion continued to repeat.

Therefore, I have focused not only on solving technical problems but also on structurally organizing **collaboration methods within the organization**.

- **Prioritizing the sharing of customer personas as a top priority**, especially defining our own personas during the prototype stage and sharing them with related departments.
- **Introducing standardized document templates to accurately convey repetitive issues between CS and the development team**.
- **Defining a Code Specification system based on a common language** to reduce language differences between departments and increase the accuracy of collaboration.
- **Integrating processes from release to operations and customer service as one system** to enable organic responses when problems arise.

## Aligning Technology and Organization Through Design

Design is not just about structural design, but about **understanding business requirements and expressing them through technology**. By understanding the purpose of each feature, both the technical structure and collaboration methods become clear.

As a designer, I have focused on **connecting the disconnection between communication and systems**, and securing technical flexibility to solve recurring problems.

- Incorporated **loose coupling** principles to reduce dependencies between functions and designed an architecture that is easy to change and maintain.
- Built and automated **CI/CD pipelines** to reduce repetitive tasks and minimize development errors. Especially designed automation centered on experience to enable collaboration under the same standards between development and operations.
- I view DevOps as more than just deployment automation; it is a cultural loop that promotes alignment and learning among teams. CI/CD is a key tool for implementing this.
- **Automated Testing and Code Review**, **designing structures that are easy to delete** to reduce Technical Debt and enhance maintenance efficiency.

These efforts were more than just technical improvements; they were a design approach that aligned **the roles and connection structures within the organization**.

## I Want to Solve These Problems

As organizations grow, recurring problems of communication, lack of standards, and unclear roles and responsibilities ultimately obstruct the customer experience and the organization's growth.

Starting from solving technical issues, I have now extended to defining the context of problems and creating structures for designed actions.

I believe I have solved similar problems numerous times.

Based on my broad perspective as a Generalist and my integrated approach as an Architect, I possess the experience and capabilities to diagnose and resolve problems both technically and organizationally.

**I want to continue to clearly analyze problems with such organizations, propose practical solutions, and create a process of growing together.**
