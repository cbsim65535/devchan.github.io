## "Why Does This Issue Keep Repeating?"

The operations team was concerned about customer interactions, the development team pondered exception handling for features, and the planning team explained that the original intent had not been properly conveyed.

While everyone made valid points, the conversation was somehow misaligned.

We were too focused on solving the problem quickly, and in the process, **we lost sight of the core value that the customers should receive.**

As the service rapidly expanded, we failed to properly manage the essence, and even the language and standards of conversation varied among teams.

In such a situation, what is most needed is to provide an **integrated design architecture** including language, systems, and domains, and through this, establish an **effective communication system** between teams. Additionally, a **common standard and consistent collaboration method** based on customer-centric thinking should be designed.

## Connecting Technology and Collaboration to Solve Problems

I have often encountered communication breakdowns and recurring technical issues between planning, development, and operations in various organizations.

During these encounters, the issues were not merely technical. **As communication and systems were separated, teams interpreted and responded to problems differently**, leading to repeated confusion.

Therefore, I have focused not only on solving technical problems but also on structurally organizing **collaboration methods within the organization**.

- **Prioritized sharing customer personas as a key task**, and especially at the prototype stage, defined our own personas to share with related departments.
- **Introduced standardized document templates to accurately convey recurring issues between CS and development teams**.
- Defined a **Code Specification system based on a common language**, reducing language differences with other departments and increasing the accuracy of collaboration.
- **Integrated procedures from release to operations and customer interactions as one system**, building a structure that can respond organically when problems arise.

## Aligning Technology and Organization Through Design

Design is not just about structural design, but about **understanding business needs and expressing them through technology**. Understanding the purpose of each feature helps clarify both technical structures and collaboration methods.

As a designer, I focused on **connecting the disconnection between communication and systems** and securing technological flexibility to solve recurring problems.

- Incorporated the principle of **loose coupling** to reduce dependencies between features and design architectures that are easy to change and maintain.
- Built and automated **CI/CD pipelines** to reduce repetitive tasks and minimize development errors. Especially, the automation was designed with experience in mind, allowing development and operations to collaborate on the same standards.
- I view DevOps as a cultural loop that promotes alignment and learning across teams, beyond just deployment automation. CI/CD is a key means to implement this.
- Enhanced maintenance efficiency and reduced Technical Debt through **Automated Testing and Code Review** and **designing easily removable structures**.

These efforts represented a design approach that aligned roles and connection structures within the organization, extending beyond mere technological improvements.

## I Want to Solve These Problems

As organizations grow, recurring problems of communication, lack of standards, and unclear roles and responsibilities ultimately hinder the customer experience and organizational growth.

Starting from solving technical problems, I have now expanded to defining the context of problems and creating structures that design behaviors.

I believe I have resolved many similar issues.

Based on my broad perspective as a Generalist and integrative approach as an Architect, I have the experience and capabilities to diagnose and solve technical and organizational problems on-site.

**Going forward, I want to continue to clearly analyze problems with such organizations, offer realistic solutions, and create a process of growth together.**
