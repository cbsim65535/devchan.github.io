**Case Study: Structuring the Development Organization's Domain and Designing Hiring Standards and Interview Flow for a New Service Deployment**  
This was a process of completing a flow that could solve problems with people, not just hiring technicians.

---

## Problem Recognition

The company wanted to realize an unmanned strategy, but  
**there was no dedicated development organization to handle it**,  
and it was unclear what roles were needed.  
We judged it difficult to internalize technology if the organization expanded without defining job roles.

---

## My Design Philosophy

I think of hiring not as "selecting people" but as  
**"designing a structure that completes a problem-solving flow with people."**  
More important than technical skills is  
**the mindset to understand the business context and solve it with technology**.

---

## Design Direction

- **Structuring the organization into 4 domains**  
  → Service Platform / Data Platform / Devices / Operations

- **Analyzing external cases and job definitions to reconstruct roles suitable for our business**  
  → Reconstructing JDs not with the existing market language but to fit our strategy

- **Formalizing the interview structure and evaluation criteria**  
  → Modularizing repetitive questions and designing around problem-solving capabilities, not just technical skills

- **Designing the post-hiring flow including the onboarding structure**  
  → Setting up a system that allows growth in line with direction even after joining

---

## Results

- Placement of multiple talents in appropriate domains based on role definition
- **Securing technology talents based on business understanding**  
- Completion of the dedicated development organization → Establishing a base for internalization of technology  
- Flexible redeployment possible in future service expansions due to domain-centric organizational structure

## In Conclusion

A technology organization is not made up solely of technology.  
**Proper role definition, context-centered evaluation criteria, and structured onboarding are necessary for technology to truly take its place in an organization.**

Through this experience,  
**I gained confidence that "a technology organization can also be designed like a platform."**
