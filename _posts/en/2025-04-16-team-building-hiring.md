# Case Study on Structuring the Development Organization and Designing Recruitment Criteria and Interview Flow for a New Service Launch  
This case study describes how **we structured the development organization's domain and designed the recruitment criteria and interview process**, not just hiring technicians but completing the process with people who can solve problems.

---

## Problem Recognition

The company wanted to implement an automation strategy, but  
**there was no dedicated development organization in-house**,  
and it was unclear what roles were needed.  
Hiring without defining job roles was seen as ineffectual for embedding technology within the organization as it expanded.

---

## My Design Philosophy

I view recruitment not as "selecting people" but as  
**"designing a structure with people who can solve problems"**.  
More important than technical skills is  
**the mindset that understands the business context and can solve problems with technology**.

---

## Design Direction

- **Structuring the organization into four domains**  
  → Service Platform / Data Platform / Devices / Operations

- **Analyzing external examples and job definitions to reconstruct roles suited to our business**  
  → Redefining JDs not in conventional market terms but aligned with our strategy

- **Formalizing the interview structure and evaluation criteria**  
  → Modularizing repetitive questions and focusing on problem-solving skills rather than technical capabilities

- **Designing the post-recruitment flow including onboarding structure**  
  → Structuring systems to ensure growth aligned with direction after joining

---

## Results

- Positioned multiple talents in suitable domains based on role definitions
- **Secured technically skilled talents based on business understanding**  
- Completed forming a dedicated development organization → Established a foundation for internal technology embedding  
- Flexible reassignment possible in future service expansions due to domain-centered organizational structure

## In Conclusion

A technology organization is not made up solely of technology.  
**Proper role definition, context-centered evaluation criteria, and a structured onboarding are necessary for technology to truly integrate within an organization.**

Our team was completed over **about 6 months and launched its first service to the market in just 4 months** after that.

- From service development,
- Contracts with third-party suppliers,
- Designing the operational agency process,
- To managing customer delivery, all were internally concluded.

As a result, about 150 customers were able to directly experience our service.  
It wasn’t massive growth, but the entire process of recognizing problems, structuring, and executing within a short time was itself a meaningful achievement.

Through this experience, I gained the confidence that **a technology organization can also be designed like a platform**.

Going forward, I plan to spend most of my time designing people and structures before adopting technology.
