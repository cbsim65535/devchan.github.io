**Transitioning from a Closed Structure Combined with Design and Development to a Skin-Module Separation Strategy and SDK-based Platform Structure**,  
**Eliminating Collaboration Bottlenecks and More Than Doubling Productivity: A Case Study**

---

## Problem Recognition

The electronic textbooks were being developed in a Flash-based structure where  
design and development were not clearly separated,  
leading to high dependency on manual work and repetitive communication between designers and developers,  
**resulting in slow collaboration speeds and high error rates.**

---

## My Design Philosophy

To solve collaboration issues, I believe that  
**increasing communication between people is not the answer,  
rather, defining 'boundaries' and designing 'ways of connection' is essential**.

**A structure where roles are distinguished and connected not through communication but through alignment**  
makes collaboration faster and more flexible.

---

## Design Direction

In this project, my approach was not just to enhance development productivity but  
**to design the collaboration flow.**

- **Separation of design (skin) and functionality (module) structure**  
- **Design of an automatic connection system based on interface naming conventions**  
- **Implementation of a bridge structure through an intermediate layer â†’ Minimizing direct consultations**  
- **Improvement of message pool/task structure and internalization of functionality engine**  
- **Packaging the entire engine in SDK form to secure an automated production base**

---

## Results

- Secured a structure where designers and developers can work in parallel  
- Reduced communication costs with an automatically connecting system without repeated consultations  
- Made feature reuse possible, **improving production efficiency by more than double**  
- Transition to a platform structure, **establishing a basis for repetitive application across different subjects and courses**

## In Conclusion

From this case study, I realized that  
**it's not the design that speeds up development, but the design that changes the collaboration flow  
that truly creates business productivity.**

An SDK is not just a bundle of code, but  
**a product of design philosophy that enables both development and collaboration simultaneously.**
